Overview

This project focuses on predicting future values in a time series dataset using machine learning techniques. Time series forecasting is essential for various applications, such as stock price prediction, weather forecasting, and sales forecasting.

Machine learning time series forecasting predicts future values based on past data trends. It uses algorithms like ARIMA, LR, SVM, Random Forest, and Decision Tree to model patterns in sequential data. Applications include stock prices, weather, and sales forecasting, enabling data-driven decision-making.
